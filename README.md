Key Features
The TicTacToe class inherits from tk.Tk and sets up the GUI for the game.
Buttons are created in a 3x3 grid, representing the game board.
Players take turns marking their symbols (X and O) on the grid.
The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move. If a player wins or the game results in a draw, a message box displays the result.
The "RESET" button allows players to start a new game.
